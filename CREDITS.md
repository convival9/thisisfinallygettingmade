Sefevi / EggsAndBakey - Sort of like the leader of the add-on

Convival - The levels named: Fire And Clouds, Dancing In A Jungle, Tropical Crystals (coldfire.stl, dancinginforest.stl, tropicalcrystals.stl)

Hume2 - The tiles used for some of these levels and the worldmap (they were in a pull reqeust on the supertux repository, that pull request was closed though)

SuperTux Team - the new images apart from the hume2 tiles are from the media repository and also from actual supertux, although some are changed a little bit (the tropiballs are recolored and the smart tropiball and the bouncing tropiball are recolored + they have glasses to protect their eyes from the sand... that they are literally made out of)
