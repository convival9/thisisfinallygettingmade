# Fanmade 0.5.1 Tropical Paradise
Fanmade SuperTux Add-On that adds Tropical Paradise. You need the tiles from Hume2's fork of supertux's "worlds" branch and when you get the tiles.strf from there, make sure to rename it to tiles2.strf and put it in the images folder. The worldmap2.strf file will be here due to it being edited. The music folder, despite being in the same folder as the levels (that as an accident) make sure you put the music folder's songs in the music folder in data/music so it works correctly. or you could probably go through every level with custom music and set it to the music folder in the levels folder, but that'd be absolutely painful to do.
