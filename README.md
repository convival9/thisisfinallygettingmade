# TropicalParadise0.5
Fanmade SuperTux Add-On that adds Tropical Paradise. You need the tiles from https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/278 and when you get the tiles.strf from there, make sure to rename it to tiles2.strf and put it in the images folder. The worldmap2.strf file will be here due to it being edited.
